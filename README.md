# PC-Assemble

**` WELCOME !`**
Have you ever wondered about the insides of a PC? Luckily, I will share my experience assembling a pc with you. This session was actually one of the activities of the subject I've taken this semester which is Technology and Information System.

 Now, I would like to share about the components and their functions.
   1. CPU - Central processing unit, or CPU. CPU is also known as the brain of the computer. The CPU interprets and executes instructions from the computerâ€™s memory, including arithmetic and logical operations, instructions for moving data around, and instructions for controlling flow.
   2. Motherboard - The computer's main circuit board that connects all of its components and allows them to communicate. Without it, none of the computer pieces, such as the CPU, GPU, or hard drive, could interact.
   3. Power Supply - Convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. 
   4. Random Access Memory (RAM) - The hardware in a computing device that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS) and is often referred to as a computer's main memory. It allows your computer to perform most of its everyday tasks, such as loading applications, browsing the internet, editing a spreadsheet, or experiencing the latest game
   5. Solid-State Drives (SSD) - Store data permanently inside an integrated circuit, typically using flash memory.
   6. Cooling fan - Regulate engine temperature by dissipating excess heat. Engines generate a tremendous amount of heat during operation, and if this heat is not managed effectively, it can lead to overheating and result in engine damage.
   7. Hard drive - Stores all of your digital content. Hard drives can be external or internal.
